Title: Tools to Visualize, Manipulate, and Summarize MCMC Output
Version: 0.6.3
Author: Casey Youngflesh
Maintainer: Casey Youngflesh <caseyyoungflesh@gmail.com>
Description: MCMCvis was designed to perform key functions for MCMC analysis
  using minimal code, in order to free up time/brainpower for interpretation of
  analysis results. Functions support simple and straightforward subsetting of
  model parameters within the calls, and produce presentable and 'publication-ready' output.
  MCMC output may be derived from Bayesian model output fit with JAGS, Stan, or other MCMC samplers.
