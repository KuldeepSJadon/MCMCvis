## Test environments
* local macOS install - R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci) - R 3.5.2
* Ubuntu 16.04 (on rhub) - R-release
* Windows Server 2008 (on rhub) - R-devel


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

r-hub Ubuntu 16.04 check notes "Author field differs from that derived from Authors@R" due to the ORCID id auto-expansion to a URL.

## Downstream dependencies

I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of MCMCvis. All packages passed.
