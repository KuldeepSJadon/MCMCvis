## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.2
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1
* win-builder (devel)


## R CMD check results
There was one NOTE in the win-builder check. Potential mis-spelling of 'MCMC' and 'subsetting'. These are not mis-spellings - NOTE should be ignored.


## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies for 'MCMCvis'
