## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

r-hub Ubuntu 16.04 check notes "Author field differs from thatdevtools::release() derived from Authors@R" due to the ORCID id auto-expansion to a URL.

## Downstream dependencies

I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of MCMCvis. All packages passed.
