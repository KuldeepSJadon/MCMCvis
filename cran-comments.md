## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, and 1 NOTE.

The NOTE specifies it has been 2 days since the last update. This quick update was pushed due to a rather glaring bug that compromises the usability of the package.


## Downstream dependencies

I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of MCMCvis. All packages passed.
